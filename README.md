# Conway's Game of Life #
	
This is my simulation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) built with JavaScript on a HTML canvas.

## Game of Life Rules ##

* Each live cell with fewer than 2 neighbors dies
* Each live cell with greater than 3 neighbors dies
* Each live cell with 2 or 3 neighbors lives
* Each dead cell with exactly 3 neighbors comes alive 

## Colorful Version ##
